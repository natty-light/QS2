Add support for float literals

add support for defining functions like:
func add(a, b) {
    a + b
}

add support for % and integer division

instanceof operator?

ensure that line number tracking for booleans work, since we set the line number in the creation function

figure out why this doesnt work
const makeCounter = func(x) {
    mut count = x;

    return func() {
        count = count + 1
        return count
    }
}

const counter = makeCounter(1);

counter();
counter();
counter();
